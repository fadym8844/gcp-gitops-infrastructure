# modules/lb
#
# With Traefik replacing Gateway API, this module is simpler:
# Traefik's LoadBalancer service gets its external IP automatically from GKE
# (a Google Cloud Network Load Balancer, provisioned automatically).
# No need to pre-reserve a static IP for a Gateway resource.
#
# This module now only provisions:
#   - A starting Cloud Armor policy (attached to the NLB via BackendConfig)
#   - Reserved static IP for Traefik's LoadBalancer service (optional but
#     recommended so the IP doesn't change on Traefik restarts)
