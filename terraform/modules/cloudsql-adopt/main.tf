# modules/cloudsql-adopt
#
# Confirmed: madkhol-dr-db's Cloud SQL instance (built for the separate MySQL
# DR migration — OCI to Cloud SQL via DMS, CDC replication) becomes the
# PERMANENT production database once it's fully caught up with OCI data. So
# this module does NOT provision a new instance — it only references the one
# that already exists, via a data source. Applying this can never accidentally
# create, modify, or delete the database.
#
# GKE deliberately does NOT live in this same project — see the README and
# envs/prod/main.tf for why that's not actually required. This module's only
# job is: read the instance's connection details, and let specific service
# accounts connect to it.
#
# Once the team is ready to manage it via Terraform going forward (flip on
# regional HA, adjust flags, etc.), `terraform import` can bring the real
# resource under management — do that as a deliberate, separately-reviewed
# step, not as part of this apply.
