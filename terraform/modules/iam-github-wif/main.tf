# Replaces however GitHub Actions currently authenticates to OCIR (I still
# don't know whether that's a long-lived auth token in repo secrets or OIDC —
# if it's a token, this is a straight security upgrade).
#
# Workload Identity Federation means GitHub Actions gets short-lived
# credentials from its own OIDC token. No service account JSON key ever exists,
# so there is no key to leak, rotate, or accidentally commit — which matters
# given `shared_credentials_file = "../credential/file"` points inside the
# Infrastructure repo tree today.
