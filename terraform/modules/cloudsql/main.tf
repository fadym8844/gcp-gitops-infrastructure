# modules/cloudsql
#
# Replaces modules/cloudsql-adopt. That module only ever read an existing
# instance in madkhol-dr-db (Doha/me-central1). Confirmed decision: fresh
# project, fresh instance, in Dammam/me-central2 - the fix this module
# actually delivers vs. the old one.
#
# Two separate things use the word "regional" - worth being precise:
#   - REGION (me-central2/Dammam): confirmed, always correct - the whole
#     point of this module existing instead of adopting the Doha instance.
#   - AVAILABILITY TYPE (HA on/off, a Cloud SQL zonal-vs-regional setting):
#     confirmed OFF, deliberately, for cost. Matches the existing Doha
#     instance's spec exactly, and matches the OCI source's own lack of HA.
#     This means the single-point-of-failure gap this migration was meant
#     to close on the database specifically is NOT closed by this instance
#     as currently configured - a real, deliberate trade-off, not an
#     oversight. Flag this explicitly wherever this spec is referenced
#     elsewhere (e.g. the migration plan document).
#
# Confirmed spec: MySQL 8.0, Enterprise edition, single zone (no HA),
# db-custom-2-13312 (2 vCPU / 13GB - matches the existing Doha instance),
# 300GB SSD. Private IP only, via the PSA range already reserved in
# modules/network. Attached to the Shared VPC directly.
